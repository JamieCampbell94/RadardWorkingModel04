  <h1>Lifecycle/Scheduling Report </h1>

  <p>At the point of submission Radard was in its 24th week of development and
    approximately 12 weeks behind the proposed schedule. Specified within
    interim 2 it was mentioned that the project was only a single week behind
    due to myself starting the 'build' section a week late. However once the
    second interim was submitted the 'build' section did not progress any
    further until the first week of the easter holidays which was scheduled as
    'spare time' on the initial time schedule. The rationale behind the lack of
    progress on the project was as a direct result of my requirement to learn
    the coding language before actually being able to code the necessary parts
    to progress the backend of the web application. Therefore between weeks 12
    and 21 i spent studying the coding languages of php, json, ajax and
    javascript during which i learn a sufficient amount to be able to start
    the 'build' section 9 weeks later then proposed.
  </p>

    <p>As it currently stands the project is only at around 50% functionality
      with the main instant messenger feature working correctly using AJAX/JSON
      to GET and POST data to and from the database with a schedule every 1
      second. The web application currently only has one chat messenger so all
      traffic to the chatHome.php will all be together. In addition to this the
      users are unable to see who posted what message as no usernames are
      tethered to the messages. Furthermore the setting of location for the
      chat radius has not been correctly coded and therefore has been removed
      currently from the web application. However i feel these are
      functionalities that are in addition to the main and could be added at a
      later date.
    </p>

    <p>However with this being said i have learnt a great deal of knowledge
      within these coding languages through being forced to spend a proficient
      amount of time learning and using the code.  In addition to this i have
      also learnt the difficulty in regaining the time lost through
      circumstances not foreseen when proposing the initial time schedule.
      Although not without great effort with trying to make the time back,
      in the 5 days leading up to the deadline i have spent a total of 31 hours
      coding to try and claw back some lost time. Furthermore i have also
      learnt the importance of maintaining an insight into the location that
      the project is at against the proposed timeline in order to gauge the
      amount of work still required within the time schedule. Where 9 weeks
      were spent frantically trying to learn the code required to code the web
      application proficiently, i was unaware of actually how far behind i was,
      in previous the interim 2 forced myself to look at the current standing
      of the project. However as there was no need for myself to locate the
      current standing of the project i become unaware of the period of time i
      have lost.
