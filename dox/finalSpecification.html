  <h1>Rationale</h1>
      <p>The approach for this web application was to focus on the functionality of the main feature for the application and once this function (instant messenger) has been correctly and proficiently coded, the other features which added additional functionality to the application would be added as it progressed.
	Therefore as the web application currently stands the main feature of the instant messenger is working correctly to include creation of the database and the use of AJAX and json and PDO to communicate sufficiently with it. This allows the user to enter into the chat and instantly send and receive messages from others within that chat messenger. From there i would have created individual user accounts, a working login system, creation of seperate chat messengers for locations and a radius selector.
